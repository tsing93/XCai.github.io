I am currently an Associate Professor in College of Transportaion, Southeast University. At the same time, I have been a Postdoctoral Fellow in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for around three years. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Southeast University in June, 2021. Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. degree from Southeast University in 2015. In the period from Sep. 2019 to May 2021, I studied at North Caroliana State University as a visiting scholar. My past work mainly focuses on the multiscale damage detecting and modelling of transportation infrastructure. Additionally, I am now and will continue to be involved in the research work on semantic digital twin based on building information model. 

Research Interests:
